# Rest Countries Angular App

This project is my first attempt at using Angular, submitted as part of a frontend technical interview. The application leverages Angular to consume data from the [Rest Countries API](https://restcountries.com/), providing users with information about different countries. Despite the challenges faced, the project showcases my efforts to navigate Angular and create a functional and responsive web application.

## Challenges Encountered

1. Using ngrx to manage state and data flow was a new concept that required a lot of research and experimentation. I still wasn't able to fully implement it, but I look forward to learning more about it.

2. Integrating and fetching data from the Rest Countries API, with its nested structures, posed a learning curve in understanding Angular services.

3. Implementing the routing module was a challenge, as I had to learn how to pass data between components

Overall, I learned a lot about Angular and its capabilities, and I look forward to continuing to learn more about it.
